# About me
Hi, Iâ€™m Gustavo Olgiati, a web developer and designer. I am passionate about solving complex problems with the use of creative digital solutions. I began my career as a U.S. Army combat photographer, capturing moments under pressure and developing an eye for details. This unique experience shaped my approach to design, where precision, adaptability, and storytelling are at the core of everything I create. I have a strong academic foundation in web design and digital media from Arizona State University, where I learned design principles, branding and coding. My experience includes projects such as designing websites, logo animations, graphics, and back-end coding.
